# CODE_A_THONE

As a programmer, you are going to work on exciting projects! One of the best parts of being a programmer is creating something that didn't exist before. And then you get control over an application, website, or whatever your creation! You can develop and maintain something very useful, which leads us to the next point

Today I don’t tell anymore but I am still passionate about my day to day work: Coding!
I love it so much that when people ask me how I can do “the same work” for so many days. I always answer that “I have never worked a day in my life since my work is also my hobby

### I love to code because it is usable art.
Just like architecture, which is an art used by people daily and affects their everyday life, so is code. You can create something and people interact with, use, touch and work with. That is an amazing feeling.

When I manage to build something that saves people time and prevents them from doing tedious tasks, I know that I am making a difference in that person’s life.
